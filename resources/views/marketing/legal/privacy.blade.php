    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>{{ config('marketing.organization') }}</strong>
    (“Azodik”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use
    <strong>Azshrtr</strong> websites, documentation, and Azshrtr Cloud
    (together, the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
    Self-hosted Azshrtr you run on your own infrastructure is governed by your own
    policies for end-user data. This policy covers our marketing site, console accounts,
    and managed Azshrtr Cloud.
</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong> — name, email, organization details, and authentication events for console users.</li>
    <li><strong>Billing data</strong> — plan selection, usage metrics (such as short URLs and QR generations), invoices, and payment status processed by our payment provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer content on Azshrtr Cloud</strong> — short links, QR codes, custom domains, API keys metadata, import/export jobs, and related settings you store in your organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Click and redirect data</strong> — technical signals needed to operate redirects and analytics (for example timestamps, referrers, and approximate location derived from IP where enabled), retained according to your plan.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data</strong> — IP address, browser type, device information, approximate location, and logs needed to operate and secure the Services.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications</strong> — messages you send us (support, sales, security reports).</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> — see our <a href="{{ route('cookies') }}">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How we use information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and improve Azshrtr and Azshrtr Cloud.</li>
    <li>Authenticate users, prevent abuse, and keep the Services secure.</li>
    <li>Meter usage, bill subscriptions, and send transactional notices (plan changes, invoices, security alerts).</li>
    <li>Respond to support and security inquiries.</li>
    <li>Understand aggregate product and marketing performance where analytics are enabled.</li>
    <li>Comply with law and enforce our <a href="{{ route('terms') }}">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal information. We may share information with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> that help us host, send email, process payments, resolve DNS/SSL for custom domains, or analyze traffic, under contractual confidentiality and purpose limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional advisors</strong> (legal, accounting) when reasonably necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Authorities</strong> when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Successors</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to this policy’s protections.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    On Azshrtr Cloud, your organization’s admins control access to that organization’s data.
    Destination URLs and end-user click data you process remain under your instructions as the controller (or equivalent).
</p>

<h2>4. International transfers</h2>
<p>
    We may process information in India and other countries where we or our providers operate.
    Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
</p>

<h2>5. Retention</h2>
<p>
    We retain information for as long as your account is active and as needed to provide the Services,
    meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Plan-specific retention for audit logs
    and click analytics is described on <a href="{{ route('pricing') }}">pricing</a>.
    You may request deletion of console account data subject to legal and operational retention needs.
    Unclaimed guest short links expire automatically after a short period.
</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
    We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect information.
    No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; please use strong credentials and
    report suspected incidents promptly.
</p>

<h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
<p>
    Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict
    processing of personal information, or to object to certain processing. Contact us using the
    details below. You may also unsubscribe from non-essential marketing emails where applicable.
</p>

<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>
    The Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal
    information from them.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes</h2>
<p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the revised version with an updated
    “Last updated” date. Material changes may be communicated through the console or email when appropriate.
</p>
